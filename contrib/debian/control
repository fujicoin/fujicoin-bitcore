Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Fujicoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Fujicoin Core

 .
 This package provides the daemon, fujicoind, and the CLI tool
 fujicoin-cli to interact with the daemon.

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Fujicoin Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 tool which can be used without a fujicoin daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
